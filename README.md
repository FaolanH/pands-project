## Project for the Programming and Scripting module
### In this project I will look at the possibilites of using Python for Data Analytics using a well-known dataset in the coding community: the Iris dataset. Through a mixture of methods I will look at different ways of exploring the data visually and what the results can be used to demonstrate. 

## Colours used in the Project
### The colours used in the plots throughout the project are based on the colours of the iris flowers. 

### Palette:

#### Iris Dataset
### Show the parts of the iris the data refers to "sepal", "petal", diagrams for each species

#### Project Plan
##### - Describe the iris dataset briefly, and how other data might have similar structure
##### - Investigate the different ways this data can be examined, in the most simple terms (inspiration from my Principles of Data Analytics course):
  ###### - meean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation 
  ###### - plotting the data on histograms/boxplots, comparing the species or across one specific species e.g. comparing petal   length across setosa, versicolor and virgininca or showing the range of petal length (min to max) in one species
  ###### - what libraries are available to help me display this data?
  ###### - can I use user input to ask the user what they want to see?
  ###### - investigate the pandas read.csv to see what can be done

##### The iris dataset has been added into this repository, including the raw data, description of the data and index.
